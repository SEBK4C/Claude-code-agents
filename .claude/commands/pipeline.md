Execute the full multi-agent pipeline for the current task.

## Usage
This command initiates the 9-stage multi-agent pipeline starting with task-breakdown.

## Instructions for Claude

When this command is invoked:

1. **DO NOT use tools directly** - You are the orchestrator
2. **Start with Stage 0** - Dispatch to task-breakdown agent
3. **Follow the pipeline sequentially**:
   - Stage 0: task-breakdown
   - Stage 1: code-discovery
   - Stage 2: plan-agent
   - Stage 3: web-syntax-researcher (if needed)
   - Stage 4: build-agent (if code needed)
   - Stage 5: debugger (if errors)
   - Stage 6: test-agent
   - Stage 7: review-agent
   - Stage 8: decide-agent

4. **Track progress** using TodoWrite
5. **Display pipeline status** after each stage
6. **Honor agent requests** for re-runs (except from decide-agent)
