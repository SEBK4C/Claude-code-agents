# Restart Pipeline

Restart the multi-agent pipeline from Stage 0.

## Usage
This command restarts the pipeline from the beginning (task-breakdown).

## Instructions for Claude

When this command is invoked:

1. **Clear current pipeline state** - Reset all stage statuses
2. **Reset budget tracking** - Each new agent instance gets fresh budget
3. **Restart from Stage 0** - Dispatch to task-breakdown
4. **Preserve context** - Include learnings from previous run if applicable

## When to Use

- After decide-agent outputs RESTART
- When user wants to start fresh with new requirements
- When pipeline is stuck or needs a clean slate
